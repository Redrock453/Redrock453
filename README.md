## Research Philosophy

> *"The best defense is knowing how you can be attacked and building systems to detect it."*

> *"Intelligence without action is merely noise. Systems must transform raw data into decisions faster than adversaries can react."*

> *"In contested environments, traditional cloud dependencies are vulnerabilities. Autonomy is resilience."*

**Autonomous Defense Systems**

Building next-generation intelligence systems that:
1. Learn from data patterns without explicit reprogramming
2. Predict threats before they materialize
3. Recommend courses of action automatically
4. Adapt to changing threat landscapes in real-time

**Core Question:** *How can multi-agent systems autonomously identify and neutralize asymmetric threats in contested environments?*
